Rivers, wetlands and oceans are choked with plastic waste, mostly from land rubbish. This plastic waste is harmful to wildlife and us. <br/>

<h3 id="canola"> WHY RUNNING FOR CLEAN WATER IS IMPORTANT </h3>
<p>
1. Every <strong>MINUTE</strong> an equivalent of one garbage truck full of plastic waste enters the oceans! <br/>
2. <strong>SEA</strong> countries are among the global top plastic consumers! <br/>
3. Only 6% <strong>RECYCLED</strong> out of 800 million kg of plastic discarded in Singapore! <br/>
4. <strong>BY 2050</strong> there could be more plastic the ocean than fish by weight!
